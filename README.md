# Readability-Algo
Python program that calculates the readability of a text using the Automated Reading Index and Coleman-Liau Index algorithms. I created this to help learn how to use python, specifically lists

To use it, type the algorithm name (ARI or Coleman-Liau) as the first arguement and the text file you wish to calculate as the second arguement.

Ex. Python ARI.py Coleman-Liau Trump.txt

I have provided two speeches from Trump and Clinton to compare their readability based on these algorithms.
The scores for both algorithms equate to the following:

***ARI***
Score: 1  Grade Level: Kingergarten
Score: 2  Grade Level: First Grade
Score: 3  Grade Level: Second Grade
Score: 4  Grade Level: Third Grade
.
.
.
Score: 14  Grade Level: College

**Coleman-Liau**
Score equates directly to grade level
Ex. score of 4.4 is approximately 4th-5th grade reading level
